# adventofcode2018
This repository holds my code for the [2018 version of advent of code](http://www.adventofcode.com/2018).

## Structure of the repository
Each day has its own subfolder containing the program and input files to solve that day's puzzle.

## Getting started
This year I have decided to use [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to solve the puzzles.
* Make sure that you have node installed and clone the repository.
* In the root folder of the repository run `npm install` to install any dependencies.
